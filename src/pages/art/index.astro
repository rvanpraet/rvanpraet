    <h1>Code as a generative art tool</h1>
    <p>
      Fascinated by technology as an art tool, I stumbled upon the world of generative art. Using code to approach the
      beauty and imperfections of nature and life is in stark contrast to what we expect from the technology that is
      created to be perfectly logical.
      <br />
      <br />
      The meaning of these works may be left in a blur of colors and shapes, but the process of creating them is a profound
      journey of attempting to make sense of the world inside us and around us.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am very open to the idea of bringing these shapes to life in the real world, bridging the gap between the digital
      and physical.
