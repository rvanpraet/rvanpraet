This 360-degree audiovisual environment investigates the nuances of depth perception and spatial awareness.<br /><br />Custom-built light fixtures generate shifting planes of illumination, their rhythm and intensity evolving in response to subtle sonic movements. As light and sound converge, fleeting after-images and resonant vibrations coalesce into a perceptual interplay that challenges orientation.<br /><br />Within this field of shifting stimuli, distinctions between surface and space, vision and sensation, gradually dissolveâ€”leaving the viewer suspended in an ever-reforming sense of depth.</p>`,

The sound design for <em>Depth Array - Reflections</em> was developed using modular synthesis and a range of outboard processing techniques to create a deeply immersive sonic atmosphere. A 15-minute audio loop was composed from layered long-form recordings, evolving slowly to complement the spatial and visual dynamics of the installation.
<br /><br />The choreography of light was precisely synchronized to the sound using Ableton and TouchDesigner, integrating audio-reactive elements with generative behaviors to achieve a sense of organic movement. A twelve-channel speaker array distributed sound throughout the space, allowing both light and audio to traverse the room and shape the perception of depth from every angle.`,
